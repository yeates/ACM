# HDU2680-Choose the best route [_link_](http://acm.hdu.edu.cn/showproblem.php?pid=2680)

##Problem Description
One day , Kiki wants to visit one of her friends. As she is liable to carsickness , she wants to arrive at her friend’s home as soon as possible . Now give you a map of the city’s traffic route, and the stations which are near Kiki’s home so that she can take. You may suppose Kiki can change the bus at any station. Please find out the least time Kiki needs to spend. To make it easy, if the city have n bus stations ,the stations will been expressed as an integer 1,2,3…n.
 

##Input
There are several test cases.   
Each case begins with three integers n, m and s,(n<1000,m<20000,1=<s<=n) n stands for the number of bus stations in this city and m stands for the number of directed ways between bus stations .(Maybe there are several ways between two bus stations .) s stands for the bus station that near Kiki’s friend’s home.  
Then follow m lines ,each line contains three integers p , q , t (0<t<=1000). means from station p to station q there is a way and it will costs t minutes .  
Then a line with an integer w(0<w<n), means the number of stations Kiki can take at the beginning. Then follows w integers stands for these stations.
 

##Output
The output contains one line for each data set : the least time Kiki needs to spend ,if it’s impossible to find such a route ,just output “-1”.
 

##Sample Input
	5 8 5  
	1 2 2  
	1 5 3  
	1 3 4  
	2 4 7  
	2 5 6  
	2 3 5  
	3 5 1  
	4 5 1  
	2  
	2 3  
	4 3 4  
	1 2 3  
	1 3 4  
	2 3 2  
	1  
	1  
 

##Sample Output
	1  
	-1


##Think
比较简单的最短路变形问题。题意是已知终点，多起点，求kiki到朋友家的最短路径。从数据量上看出该题不适合floyd(n可趋于1000易TLE)，
若直接使用使用for(m)循环嵌套Dijkstra也很有可能超时，而Dijkstra算法能求出单源最短路，且终点也正好只有一个，所以这里只用将终点
和起点反着考虑一下，用Dijkstra反向求出终点到图中其他点的距离，然后在起点输入过程中找到距终点的最小距离即可。
